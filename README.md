## Usage
You command, Maximus executes. Ranging from creating a simple file in your desktop to creating a personal website or an application, Maximus can do whatever you say so. Built in [Vermillion](https://github.com/theoneandonlyshadow/Scarlett-Vermillion/) lets Maximus understand and respond effectively.

**Please note that MaxTac or any of my projects do not share/reveal/track or store user's data in any way. I have full control in all of my projects including MaxTac.**
