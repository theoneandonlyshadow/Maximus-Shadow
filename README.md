## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Maximus Shadow is a Machine Learning Intelligence that uses Sentiment Analysis as an additional feature. ùêåax is used for expanding its knowledge about the user by the use of ML. It also uses Sentiment Analysis to further expand its knowledge about the user's behavioral patterns to give the best suitable responses.

Note: ùêåaximus Shadow is **not** an open source project. It's source code will not be public and this applies to all the MaxTac projects.

## Usage

Computes complex and difficult mathematical inputs and displays in user friendly mode. This is also used to improve and enhance the quality of [Vermillion](https://github.com/theoneandonlyshadow/Scarlett-Vermillion/) and [Shadow](https://github.com/theoneandonlyshado/Maximus-Shadow/) to provide better and understandable responses.

With the powerful features of Sentiment Analysis, MaxTac is able to understand the user's emotions and responses are sent accordingly.

**Please note that MaxTac or any of my projects do not share/reveal/track or store user's data in any way. I have full control in all of my projects including MaxTac.**

## Roadmap

See the [portfolio](https://theoneandonlyshadow.github.io/madhav.github.io/) for my detailed roadmap and about how i got this idea.

## License

This is a Closed Source Project. Henceforth, source code will not be public. Please read why below.

## Important

This is a closed source project. Source code will not be public. It is done so to protect the integrity of MaxTac without the fear of getting stolen or improvised and avoid reselling without any credit for the actual author (me).

However, dependencies and installation process will be shared in some time to recreate the project on your own.
